[00:04.65] 空はまるで君のように青く澄んでどこまでも
[00:15.92] やがて僕ら描き出した明日へと走り出す
[00:24.92] 
[00:26.96] 旅立つけど looking in the rear view mirror
[00:30.40] I got you here 少しだけ clearer
[00:32.99] I know with you 全てが広がっていく
[00:37.55] All we need is just a little more time 流れてるから
[00:42.18] Everyday look at yourself and smile
[00:45.09] Hoping things will go your way.
[01:00.59] 
[00:47.65] 確かなことなど何も 誰にもわからないから
[00:57.94] どんなことが起こるだろう 手を繋いで I'll never let you get away
[01:20.94] 
[01:07.84] 空はまるで君のように青く澄んでどこまでも
[01:18.44] やがて僕ら描き出した明日へと走り出す
[01:27.44] 
[01:28.94] 1... 1... hey I wish we hadn't departed,
[01:31.78] But now your life has started,
[01:32.94] We met at the shop, and still have something in common.
[01:35.11] そしていつかわかる？
[01:36.87] I'm hoping everything is fun,
[01:38.42] 季節が巡るよ
[01:40.12] 互いに過ごした日々があるから
[01:43.84] I'm happy ya had the time to stay.
[01:45.76] Letting it back, to chat, chillin' and bringin' it back.
[02:13.76] 
[01:48.47] 確かなことなど何も 誰にもわからないから
[02:00.49] どんなことが起こるだろう 手を繋いで
[02:09.49] 
[02:10.69] 空はまるで君のように青く澄んでどこまでも
[02:21.02] やがて僕ら描き出した明日へと走り出す
[02:30.02] 
[02:32.22] Everyday I wake up thinking of you
[02:40.88] You make it all clear to me
[02:43.28] What I want you to do
[02:44.80] Leave it up to you
[02:46.00] I always knew you'd make it somewhere
[02:47.86] You're pushin' it for the top
[02:49.13] You never can stop
[02:50.36] Enjoy the ride
[02:52.82] And you know I'll always be there for you
[02:55.25] So make every moment true
[02:57.95] 'Cause we all grow up and and our time is running out
[03:02.98] (But) we can teach our youth
[03:04.97] That's what life's all about
[03:08.56] Maybe you'll fall in love
[03:11.17] I maybe be your guide 'till then
[03:13.56] 気持ち抑えきれずに... yeah
[03:22.06] 
[03:18.52] それはまるで涙のように溢れ出すよいつまでも
[03:28.81] 出会った日の喜びも いつの日か いつの日か
